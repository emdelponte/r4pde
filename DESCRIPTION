Description: Datasets and utility functions to support the book
    "R for Plant Disease Epidemiology" (R4PDE). It includes functions for quantifying disease,
    assessing spatial patterns, and modeling plant disease epidemics based on weather predictors.
    These tools are intended for teaching and research in plant disease epidemiology. Several functions
    are based on classical and contemporary methods, including those discussed in Laurence V. Madden,
    Gareth Hughes, and Frank van den Bosch (2007) <doi:10.1094/9780890545058>.
